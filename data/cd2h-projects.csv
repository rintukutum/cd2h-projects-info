"A Descriptive Analysis of Patients with COVID-19 Infection across MaineHealth","Lead Investigator: Christina Holt","Accessing Institution: Maine Medical Center","We will perform a retrospective analysis of COVID-19 data that includes confirmed cases and persons under investigation (PUI) from all MaineHealth institutions to understand demographic distribution, spectrum of disease severity as well as hospitalization and mortality rates.  In the state of Maine, over 31,000 people have been infected with SARS-CoV2-virus and more than 453 people have died. The counties in Maine served by a MaineHealth member hospital or clinic include: Cumberland, York, Oxford, Franklin, Sagadahoc, Lincoln, Knox and Waldo, and Aroostook, which combined account for 66% of reported cases in Maine according to Maine CDC data as of January 13, 2021.The risks of serious disease and death in COVID-19 cases increases with advancing age and presence of comorbid health conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus, heart failure immunosuppressive states such as post solid organ transplant patients. To prevent the spread and death from this virus, identifying symptoms early, performing tests to detect cases, and isolating infected individual has been critical.  National and local data have shown that COVID-19 disproportionately affects the elderly, those living in congregate care settings, and racial and ethnic minorities. For those of us in the MaineHealth system, knowing how this condition has presented in our patient population, what the demographic profile, medical complexity and service utilization has been will help us to focus our educational efforts for staff, learners and community. There has been no comprehensive descriptive report of the first six months of the pandemic and we aim to describe MaineHealth?s early experiences. We plan to perform a retrospective analysis of all patients with identified with COVID-19 across the MaineHealth system submitted to the N3C from January 2020 through December 31, 2020. Our specific Aims include: 1. Analyze N3C data available to MaineHealth for COVID-19 from January 1 ? December 31, 2020, including demographic, medical diagnostic and service utilization data. 2. Perform descriptive data analyses of COVID-19 cases by geographic area.  3. Describe hospitalization, disease severity and mortality rates among confirmed cases by geographic area.Our study will add knowledge about COVID-19 across the MaineHealth system. By analyzing and summarizing the demographic distribution of COVID-19 infection, understanding the spectrum of disease severity, as well as having the knowledge of hospitalization and mortality rates, we will learn which segment of the population is affected and who is at risk of developing severe disease and dying from COVID-19 in the MaineHealth service area."
"A machine learning strategy for identifying drugs that affect COVID-19 outcome","Lead Investigator: Justin Reese","Accessing Institution: Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory","We have constructed a COVID-19 knowledge graph and developed a graph machine learning method for identifying drugs that affect COVID-19 outcome. This effort has yielded a short list of drugs that warrant further investigation using clinical data. We propose to use the N3C cohort in a retrospective case-cohort study to identify drugs on our shortlist that have a statistically significant effect on COVID-19 outcome, after controlling for comorbidities and other confounding factors."
"Acute Kidney Injury in COVID-19","Lead Investigator: Moustafa Younis","Accessing Institution: University of Kansas Medical Center","Hypercoagulability with microvascular involvement has been described in patients with severe COVID-19.  According to a study performed on 44 ICU patients, thromboelastogram found a complete lack of clot lysis in 57% of the patients and that was associated with a high rate of kidney failure, need for hemodialysis and thromboembolic events. These results suggest that the development of microemboli and microthrombi in the context of hypercoagulability could be strong contributors to AKI. This highlights the potential role of anticoagulation in the prevention or treatment of AKI in patients with severe COVID-19. Early identification of kidney involvement in patients with COVID-19 and the use of preventive and/or therapeutic measures are vital to limit consequent AKI or progression to more severe stages thus reducing morbidity and mortality.Aim: In our study, we aim to retrospectively investigate 1) the impact of anticoagulation on the rates of AKI , 2) the impact of anticoagulation on the rates of progression to RRT, 3) identify predictors of AKI in patients with COVID-19, 4) describe COVID patients at different d-dimer level"
"Acute Kidney Injury in Pediatric COVID-19 Patients","Lead Investigator: ADAM DZIORNY","Accessing Institution: University of Rochester","Adult patients with COVID-19 have a high incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI). The cause of AKI is multifactorial and is hypothesized to include direct viral injury and inflammation of the kidneys, pre-existing conditions conferring a higher risk, and treatment sequelae such as nephrotoxic medications. The purpose of this study is to better characterize acute kidney injury in pediatric patients (< 18 years old) with and without COVID-19. Specifically we request Level 2 (de-identified) data to ask the following questions: 1) What is the incidence of AKI among pediatric patients, both with and without COVID-19; 2) What risk factors predict the development of AKI in pediatric COVID-19 patients; 3) What are the outcomes of patients with and without AKI; 4) What is the time-course of AKI resolution; and 5) How are treatments, including medication and technology (e.g. CRRT or ECMO) associated with AKI progression or resolution. These final three questions will stratify AKI by KDIGO severity criteria."
"Adaptive and interpretable machine learning to predict COVID-19 trajectory and severity ","Lead Investigator: Matthew Robinson","Accessing Institution: Johns Hopkins University","The clinical trajectory of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 is highly variable. Traditional measures of association reported by observational studies are difficult for clinicians to apply to understand an individual patient?s risk of developing severe disease. Conversely, the underlying logic driving machine learning-based predictions of COVID-19 severity are difficult to interpret which limits the ability of treating clinicians to trust their insight. The goal of this project is to design and implement a series of prediction tools driven by machine learning that use adaptive inputs and highly intuitive summaries to deliver accurate predictions that front-line clinicians can use to understand an individual patient?s risk of progression from COVID-19 diagnosis to hospitalization, severe disease, and death."
"AI-Assisted Assessment, Tracking, and Reporting of COVID-19 Severity on Chest CT","Lead Investigator: Asser Elkassem;Abou;Abou Elkassem","Accessing Institution: University of Alabama at Birmingham","COVID-19 is a severe infectious respiratory disease. In this pandemic, some patients with COVID-19 are at high risk of respiratory collapse and death, and there is a need to identify patients at high risk and to monitor therapy. Chest CT images contain information that can be used to monitor disease severity. However, current text-based reporting of chest CT findings in COVID-19 patients by radiologists are subjective, highly variable between radiologists, inefficient to generate and interpret, prone to interpretation errors, frequently omit key findings, and do not provide quantitative data in a standardized format. In patients with COVID-19, there are research methods to assess the percentage of lung involvement of COVID-19 on chest CT images that predict disease severity. However, this method requires a complex, manual workflow to complete and is subject to errors, omissions, and high inter-observer variability. Collectively, the lack of consistent data hinders disease profiling by epidemiologists and public health officials. This project proposes to research and develop an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted COVID-19 CT imaging workflow for radiologists to rapidly and objectively quantify the percentage of lung involvement, track common and uncommon COVID-19 lung findings, and automatically generate reports with a graph, key images, and structured text. To perform algorithm training, we are requesting the Level 2, de-identified N3C data set. We hypothesize that the proposed AI-assisted workflow will reduce interpretation errors and omissions and improve accuracy, standardization, inter-observer agreement, efficiency, and reporting in evaluation of COVID-19 disease severity and response to treatment."
"Alcohol Use and Respiratory Outcomes in COVID19 Infections","Lead Investigator: Alfred Anzalone","Accessing Institution: University of Nebraska Medical Center","Heavy alcohol use (>4 drinks/day for women and >5 drinks/day for men) is a known risk factor for bacterial pneumonia and the development of ARDS. Certain respiratory viruses such as RSV are also more severe in those that drink heavily. It is not currently known whether alcohol use increases the susceptibility to infection with SARS-CoV2 or worsens disease severity."
"Analysis of factors associated with survival from SARS-CoV-2 infections","Lead Investigator: Thomas Hartka","Accessing Institution: University of Virginia","This project will demographics and treatments associate with survival from SARS-CoV-2 infections.  Demographics will include factors such as age, sex, comorbidity, and ethnicity.   Treatment factors will focus on medications which have been shown in clinical trials to improve mortality."
"Analysis of previous exposure to influenza vaccine and influenza virus to COVID-19 Patient Outcomes","Lead Investigator: Paul Grant","Accessing Institution: University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","We hypothesize that exposure to either an influenza infection, or the seasonal influenza virus has a positive influence on COVID-19 positive patients and their documented medical outcomes. This study will explore influenza vaccine and infections and their relationships to the outcomes of COVID-19 positive patients."
"Analysis of Time Windows as Determining Factors for COVID-19 Patient Outcomes","Lead Investigator: Arti Patel","Accessing Institution: University of Virginia","Protocol that determines if a patient should be tested for COVID-19 may depend on presence of certain symptoms and vital signs. If presence of certain symptoms in combination with the length of time before getting tested has an impact on patient outcomes, we would like to find the optimal time window that leads to better patient outcomes."
"Antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 in people with multiple sclerosis treated with B cell depleting therapies","Lead Investigator: Alfred Anzalone","Accessing Institution: University of Nebraska Medical Center","We aim to investigate IgG antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 in patients with multiple sclerosis who are being treated with B-cell depleting therapies such as rituximab and ocrelizumab given B-cell deleting therapies may impair or blunt antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and impact future vaccine readiness."
"Antithrombotic therapies in COVID-19","Lead Investigator: Ivy Benjenk","Accessing Institution: George Washington University","Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is associated with hypercoagulability and increased thrombotic risk in critically ill patients. There is increasing evidence that anti-thrombotics may be associated with improved outcomes in hospitalized COVID19 patients, however all previous retrospective studies have had small patient populations. Additionally, there is conflicting information on what anti-thrombotics and what doses (e.g. therapeutic anticoagulation vs. prophylactic anticoagulation) are best at balancing clinical benefits and potential adverse effects. By harnessing the tremendous volume of observations in the NC3 collaborative, we believe that we can answer some of these questions."
"Assessing COVID Re-infection Risk Factors","Lead Investigator: Shawn ONeil","Accessing Institution: Oregon State University","This project aims to identify risk factors associated with identified COVID re-infections, especially those associated with available demographic factors (age, sex, race, ethnicity) and chronic medical conditions (e.g. diabetes, heard disease, neurological conditions, asthma, COPD, anemia)."

"Assessment of correlations between risk factors and symptom presentation among defined at-risk groups ","Lead Investigator: Jamie Henzy","Accessing Institution: Northeastern University","We propose to use COVID patient data to find any associations between factors such as age, gender, comorbidities and COVID symptoms or symptom length. For example, do immunocompromised patients with COVID more frequently experience nausea? We'll take an exploratory approach using statistical methods and visualization techniques appropriate to multidimensional data sets. Any correlations identified may allow us to find patterns in disease presentation specific to a given population, informing treatment regimens and precautions."
"Association between duration of Heated High Flow and Non-Invasive Ventilation and duration of Mechanical Ventilation in COVID-19 Patients who require Invasive Mechanical Ventilation","Lead Investigator: David Douin","Accessing Institution: University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus","An increasing number of COVID-19 patients are avoiding invasive mechanical ventilation by utilizing both heated high flow nasal cannula (HHFNC) and non-invasive ventilation (NIV) such as BiPAP and CPAP. However, many patients fail these oxygenation modalities and still require invasive mechanical ventilation. Patients who fail HHFNC and NIV may have an increased work of breathing during. This may make them more vulnerable to ventilator induced lung injury than those who were intubated earlier in their disease course. We hypothesize increased duration of HHFNC or NIV in patients who later require invasive mechanical ventilation is associated with increased duration of invasive mechanical ventilation."
"Association between GLP1 receptor agonist (GLP1-RA) and sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) use and COVID-19 outcomes: A national retrospective cohort study","Lead Investigator: Trine Julie Abrahamsen","Accessing Institution: Novo Nordisk","Emerging evidence from the COVID-19 pandemic suggest that patients with type 2 diabetes comprise a significant portion of the affected population and are at higher risk for severe outcomes including hospitalization and death yet it remains largely unknown how pre-morbid medication may impact outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with type 2 diabetes. Several medications have biologically plausible mechanisms with relevance for patients with diabetes among others including ACE inhibitors, metformin, and DPP4-inhibitors. Recent large cardiovascular outcome trials and subsequent metanalyses have demonstrated that some glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) and sodium-glucose-linked cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are associated with a reduction of cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality among the same high-risk populations who show higher susceptibility to severe COVID-19 and increased mortality. Yet, no studies have examined the class effect of these newer anti-hyperglycemic of mortality and other outcomes in the setting of COVID-19 infection. These data are critical because therapeutics represent a highly actionable intervention point to improve outcomes from both the inpatient and outpatient setting for a large population of patients with inherently high risk for COVID-19 associated mortality. To address this gap and inform evolving care guidelines for patients with medication-managed type 2 diabetes during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study aims to characterize the association of use of GLP1-RA and SLGT2i with COVID-19 outcomes using real world data from the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C). We will consider the well-studied and commonly used class of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i) as the active comparator drug to avoid confounding by indication."

"Automated exploratory subgroup analysis to identify vulnerable subgroups and examine heterogeneous treatment effects of interventions in COVID-19","Lead Investigator: AMOL RAJMANE","Accessing Institution: IBM","The overarching goal of this research is to evaluate variations of care associated with Covid-19 outcomes and related interventions. Our specific objectives are threefold. First, we aim to identify subgroups (possibly spanning an arbitrary number of features including patient history and co-morbidities) that have much higher rates of adverse events (critical disease, mortality), as compared to the average rate across all sampled Covid-19 patients. Second, we aim to examine the heterogeneous treatment effects of different Covid-19 treatment strategies to identify the subgroups of Covid-19 patients whose outcomes are most impacted by the treatments.  Third, we aim at demonstrating how the subgroup insights can be used to improve the prediction and granularity of dynamical Covid-19 disease models.Subgroup analyses are common techniques that can be used to identify non-random variations of care among Covid-19 patients. However, to conduct subgroup analyses, researchers often have to specify their objectives and reasons for subgroup analysis a priori, define the subgrouping variables upfront, and correct for the multiple comparisons problem. Unfortunately, conventional approaches for conducting subgroup analyses require domain expertise and, more importantly, limit researchers to analyzing only a few variables, beyond which it becomes computationally infeasible. Furthermore, these approaches lack a ?data-driven knowledge discovery? aspect as investigators must suggest a priori which subgrouping variables they would like to investigate. Our methodological goal is to address the limitations of conventional subgroup analysis approaches by extending subset scanning techniques from the anomalous pattern detection literature to support insight discovery through an automated exploratory subgroup analysis approach."
"Benchmarking Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based synthetic EHR data generation methods for enabling COVID-19 research","Lead Investigator: Justin Guinney","Accessing Institution: Sage Bionetworks","The goal of this project is to benchmark existing Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based algorithms for generating synthetic feature sets to predict COVID-19 caused hospitalization and to establish the standards for assessing the quality of synthetic data. We will preprocess the N3C de-identified dataset to a feature set including patients? demographics, condition, procedure and drug code and apply GAN models on this feature set to generate synthetic data. We will assess the quality of synthetic data in terms of its statistical resemblance to real data, its utility for making hospitalization predictions, as well as privacy risks. This work complements - and will be coordinated with - the Synthetic Data workstream."
"Burden of COVID-19 Pandemic in US Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: a National Study Using the N3C Data Enclave","Lead Investigator: Paul Reyfman","Accessing Institution: Northwestern University","Observational studies have suggested that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a risk factor for worse outcomes from COVID-19 pneumonia, including more severe disease, greater risk of respiratory failure, and greater risk of mortality.

"Cardiovascular Complications of COVID-19","Lead Investigator: Johanna Loomba","Accessing Institution: University of Virginia","This study is aimed to assess the cardiovascular and pulmonary complications in patients suffering from COVID-19. The results of this study will help health-care providers assess the severity and prevalence of COVID-related complications and risk-stratify the patients accordingly.  The clinical impact of this work is expected to be a better understanding of mechanisms associated with adverse events from COVID-19. The long-term impact could be determination of approaches to improve outcomes for these patients in the future."
"Cardiovascular differences amongst different racial groups who have been exposed to COVID-19","Lead Investigator: Nicholas Garcia","Accessing Institution: University of California, Irvine","We are currently aware that COVID-19 affects the pulmonary and cardiovascular system during infection and post-infection. This study aims to look deeper into the specific cardiovascular complications that affect patients who have been exposed to COVID-19 (i.e. changes in blood pressure, heart rate, RBC, platelets, etc). Considering that the pandemic has caused patients to postpone their regular visits with their cardiologist, we believe this analysis can help clinicians understand how to care for patients with cardiovascular complications post-pandemic. This study can also help us understand which patients may be at greater risk for future, greater cardiovascular complications.More importantly, we aim to stratify the data and analyze the cross-section of cardiovascular health and racial differences. This is really important due to recent public health studies showing that minority communities are more negatively affected by the pandemic. This focused racial analysis can help clinicians find more personalized treatments for patients and could help highlight the need for greater COVID relief to at-risk communities."
"Case-Control Studies of Medications and Their Possible Associations with COVID-19 Severity","Lead Investigator: Alejandro Schaffer","Accessing Institution: National Cancer Institute","Project Summary: The current COVID-19 pandemic, which began in China in last December, has already caused over 1 million deaths world-wide (1). This is an unprecedented threat, to which scientists must find a response, using all the resources which can be made available. The Cancer Data Science Lab, led by Prof. Eytan Ruppin, M.D., Ph.D. in the National Cancer Institute (henceforth the CDSL), specializes in the application of data science tools, and in particular computational biology and systems biology, in order to identify better diagnostics, better treatments, and prevention strategies to cancer and other preventable diseases. I am a Staff Scientist in the CDSL.We have established a collaboration with Dr. Ariel Israel, M.D., Ph.D. in Clalit Health Services (CHS), the largest health insurer in Israel which has over 4.5 million members. Our goal is to harness this unique resource to identify preventable risk factors for COVID-19 and possible treatments. CHS' database has already served to show the strong link between vitamin D deficiency and the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease severity.In our most recent collaborative work, we have systematically analyzed the CHS database to identify drugs which when acquired in the month before SARS-CoV-2, decrease the risk of severe disease and hospitalization. In this analysis, we have identified a few medications, like ezetimide, rosuvastatin, ubiquinone and fleicanide, which we found to be associated with a significantly decreased risk of hospitalization.  Combining these epidemiological findings, with patterns of gene expression following coronavirus infection, we came to identify the very specific pathways and molecular mechanisms which are targeted by the virus, and the mechanisms by which these drugs prevent severe disease.Reproducing and analyzing data from different populations is of crucial importance to establish the validity of epidemiologic results. In this application, we request access to N3C data in order to replicate and extend our understanding of preventable risk factors for severe COVID-19."
"Causal comparative effectiveness analysis of COVID-19 treatment strategies","Lead Investigator: Liangyuan Hu","Accessing Institution: Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai","The COVID-19 pandemic is an evolving crisis threatening global health and economies. Public health experts believe that this pandemic has no true precedent in modern times. To this date, optimal treatment strategies, including treatment classes (e.g., anticoagulant drugs, anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, etc.) and treatment timing are still unclear. Several national and international randomized controlled trials (RCT) are being conducted to compare the effect of one or two treatment strategies. It is infeasible, however, especially in a time of crisis, to conduct RCT to investigate all possible treatment strategies. In addition, RCT inclusion and exclusion criteria often limit generalizability to frail populations, precisely the demographic most at risk of severe morbidity and mortality. We aim to leverage the continuously growing COVID-19 data collected across the nation to validate and compliment the randomized trials. We will conduct in-depth investigations of the comparative effectiveness of multiple treatment options and the treatment interactions therein (as many patients take more than one type of medications at the same time) in real-world settings. Furthermore, research is needed to understand heterogeneity in effectiveness of COVID-19 treatments in vulnerable subgroups of patients.  The most vulnerable patients include frail elderly, disadvantaged racial groups, and those who have immune suppression, like patients with cancer, HIV, organ transplant, or users of immunosuppressing medications. This project has two aims. In Aim 1, we will develop i) a continuous-time joint marginal structural model and ii) a Bayesian machine learning based methods to evaluate the causal comparative effectiveness of multiple treatment strategies. We will stratify our analyses for pre-ICU and post-ICU patients.  In Aim 2, we will develop a data-driven method to estimate the treatment effect heterogeneity, particularly in vulnerable subpopulations."

"Characterization of long-COVID: definition, stratification, and multi-modal analysis","Lead Investigator: Tell Bennett","Accessing Institution: University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus",""Long COVID" patients have exhibited significant and heterogeneous symptoms such as fatigue, brain-fog, sleep disturbances, anxiety, and depression, etc. Therefore, there is an urgent need to use the data held within the N3C to perform stratification so as to provide a robust set of phenotypes for diagnosis and subsequent treatment management. A Long-COVID phenotype will support prognostic characterization of different substrata, potentially more precise care management, and greatly inform prospective interventional studies. We will describe the incidence, timing, and severity of sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection in adults and children and ascertain incidence rates across different demographic groups and differences in outcomes based upon early disease course characterization. The characterization will include public external datasets related to potential environmental and social determinants of health available in N3C. This is a N3C Consortium project."

"Continued In-Hospital ACEi and ARB Use in Hypertensive COVID-19 Patients ","Lead Investigator: Tim Duong","Accessing Institution: Albert Einstein College of Medicine","We (Lam et al. J Infectious Disease, PMID: 32702098) recently reported that continued use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) during hospitalization of 614 hypertensive COVID-19 patients yields better clinical outcomes, compared to those who discontinue such drug hypertensive use in the hospital. This is important because all previous studies to date reported only neutral (non-negative) effects of continued hypertensive drug use during hospitalization, whereas we found that in-hospital continuation of ACEi/ARB use was associated with better outcomes compared to in-hospital discontinuation of ACEi/ARB use.      We attributed our novel finding to our accounting for the developed hypotension and acute kidney injury (AKI) during hospitalization. In other words, in the absence of hypotension or AKI, patients who continued ACEi/ARBs had lower mortality and critical illness rates compared to those who discontinued them, supporting the notion that continued ACEi/ARB use may have beneficial effects. Our findings came from a single academic hospital with small sample size. The main goal of this N3C proposal is to determine whether this finding is generalizable to the N3C cohort."
"Contribution of Race and other Social Determinants of Health to Disparities in Patient Outcomes in COVID-19","Lead Investigator: Xuan Han","Accessing Institution: University of Chicago","As the COVID-19 pandemic has progressed and increasing data has become available on patient outcomes, a striking pattern has emerged: Black and Hispanic Americans exhibit disproportionately high rates of positive diagnoses, hospitalizations, and deaths. These disparities, which have been demonstrated across the country, have generated significant concern. Numerous hypotheses have been proposed to explain them, addressing a wide range of topics from individual physiology to unequal access to care, but they remain incompletely understood. We aim to use the N3C Limited Data Set to better characterize these disparities and to investigate how various patient- and community-level factors may be contributing to them."
"Convalescent Plasma Administration Effect on COVID-19","Lead Investigator: Joy Alamgir","Accessing Institution: ARI Science","The purpose of this research is to assess the effect of Convalescent Plasma (CP) administration on COVID+ patients against 3 specific clinical endpoints. The endpoints are: death, time to recovery and organ failure. This is an important research as, despite spotty high quality trails data,  thousands of patients have received CP as part of the National Expanded Access Program (EAP) for convalescent plasma initiated in early April 2020 and under a subsequent Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) initiated in August 2020 for COVID. This study aims to either confirm or invalidate clinical endpoint effectiveness of such Convalescent Plasma administration using N3C data. As of the writing of this DUR there are around 4600 patients that have plasma administration records (both non-convalescent and convalescent plasma) with N3C. As this number seems lower than our expectation we plan to work with N3C data ingestion team to see if there could be data ingestion improvements to get a higher N for the analysis."

However, data on patients suffering from both cancer and heart diseases is unknown. Recent and concomitant chemotherapy use can mitigate immune response and make patients with cancer more prone to infection. Certain cardiac conditions such as heart failure could also worsen inflammatory state and subsequently blunting immune response. Thus, outcomes of patients with cancer and cardiac conditions could be worse. To date, no large scale data has looked at the outcomes of patients with cancers and co-existing cardiac conditions."

"COVID-19 and Percutaneous Catheterization Interventions: Modeling Risk of Serious Adverse Outcomes","Lead Investigator: John Davis","Accessing Institution: The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston","Little is known about the safety of percutaneous catheterization interventions (PCI) with subsequent COVID-19 infection. Because of the numerous thrombotic complications associated with COVID-19  infection, it is hypothesized that patients receiving PCI and subsequently infected with COVID-19 (within 90 days of PCI) will experience increased rates of stent thrombosis, sudden death, and new cardiovascular disease. Using the N3C database, we aim to assess the odds of suffering a composite endpoint -- PCI complication (defined as stent thrombosis, sudden death, or new myocardial infarction) -- in patients who were infected with COVID-19 within 90 days following PCI, as compared to patients who were not infected by COVID-19 within the same time frame. Logistic regression analysis is planned to assess for comparative odds of this severe composite outcome, while controlling for relevant co-morbidities and demographic factors."

Secondary outcomes include preterm birth and other complications of pregnancy that have underlying placental abnormalities.Objectives, designs, and plans: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused substantial mortality. Sema4 carried out a pilot study using COVID-19 data from the Mount Sinai Health System EMR. Our pilot study results are detailed in a manuscript entitled ?Analysis of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the Mount Sinai Health System using electronic medical records (EMR) reveals important prognostic factors for improved clinical outcomes? (MedRxiv and accepted by BMJ open). We realized that a significant number of critical data fields are needed in EMR, which will lead a better systematic evaluation on the safety and efficacy of different treatments, as well as identification of additional risk factors for prognostic outcomes. We believe the N3C COVID data provides the opportunity for a more expansive assessment of the impacts of COVID-19 on human disease and wellness, and a richer dataset to build and test predictive models that may better assess the risk of complications from COVID-19.

"COVID-19 infection and mortality among individuals with disabilities","Lead Investigator: Jamie Doyle","Accessing Institution: National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences","Individuals with disabilities may not be able to practice social distancing and other COVID-19 preventive measures due to their impairment, potential reliance on caregivers for activities of daily living, and the necessity to continue essential therapies. The purpose of this study is to examine geographic variation and correlates of COVID-19 infection and mortality rates of individuals with developmental, intellectual, and physical impairments as compared to those without. Rates will be weighted based on population size of the zip code and stratified by disability. A survival analysis will be performed with mortality as the outcome. Results from this study will help inform public health interventions targeting this vulnerable population."
"COVID-19 medications prescribing habits throughout the pandemic","Lead Investigator: Scott Helgeson","Accessing Institution: Mayo Clinic","COVID-19 has infected nearly 11 million people in the US and there is limited effective treatments for the disease. There has been many potential treatments that have come and gone and have not proven to be effective. This study is aimed towards determining the use of specific medications and how frequently they were used throughout the pandemic and how prescribing habits were effected by publications in the medical literature. We will also be looking at how social media impacted these prescribing habits."
"COVID-19 Outcomes in Patients with Cirrhosis","Lead Investigator: Jin Ge","Accessing Institution: University of California, San Francisco","Liver involvement is common during COVID-19 and is associated with asymptomatic liver function test elevations to acute hepatic decompensation.  Existing studies of the outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with cirrhosis have been limited by small sample sizes and selection bias - for example, a recent study of the national VA database consisted of a population enriched with patients with chronic hepatitis C and male veterans.  There is a need, therefore, for better definition of the outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with cirrhosis in a more representative population.   In this study, we aim to leverage the N3C Database to determine the outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with cirrhosis and patients with chronic liver diseases."
"COVID-19 pandemic associated adverse drug event disproportionality differences","Lead Investigator: Richard Boyce","Accessing Institution: University of Pittsburgh","The purpose of this PV analysis is to compare the ten most frequently reported ADEs for each of the twenty most commonly used medications in COVID-19 patients during pre-pandemic, post-pandemic, and post-pandemic when confirmed to be used for direct treatment of COVID-19. The secondary aim of this study is to investigate if there is a significant difference in the top ten reported ADEs and frequency of ADEs between genders and between age groups (18-64 and >65) during post-pandemic for each drug with confirmed use for direct COVID-19 treatment. A robust list of medications used in COVID-19 patients that are currently being studied was compiled through use of NCBI-PubMed Central, Clinicaltrials.gov., and the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. Concept sets were created on ATLAS for each medication. Using these concept sets, the twenty most commonly used medications will be identified through the National COVID Cohort Collaboration (N3C). Once the top twenty medications are identified, comparison data of reported ADEs pre-pandemic, post-pandemic, and post-pandemic for direct COVID-19 treatment will be collected through a query of the FAERS database from September 11th, 2019 - March 1st, 2021. ADEs for comparison will also be obtained from Micromedex. Disproportionality analysis using reporting odds ratios will be used to compare frequencies of ADEs between time periods, genders, and age groups. Overall, our findings may aid as a future reference for selecting clinically safe medications for use in COVID-19 patients by revealing patterns of ADEs between different groups, as well as providing updated data on common ADEs seen in medications used for COVID-19 treatment or symptom alleviation."

"COVID-19 Treatments Associated with Lower Mortality ","Lead Investigator: Sally Hodder","Accessing Institution: West Virginia University","There are no clear data on the best treatments for COVID-19 to minimize mortality in various populations.  As an example, an NIH randomized clinical trial concluded that remdesivir was superior to placebo among hospitalized patients, significantly shortening time to recovery (10 vs. 15 days).1 Though mortality was significantly lower in the remdesivir group at day 15 (6.7% vs. 11.9%), mortality at day 29 trended lower (11.4% vs. 15.2%) but did not reach statistical significance. In contrast, a recent World Health Organization guidelines panel recommended against remdesivir use citing that there is currently no evidence that it improves survival.  The WHO guideline was based on analysis of four clinical trials conducted among 7000 patients.2  This project utilizing the N3C database seeks to evaluate what therapies are associated with the lowest mortality among various populations."

This will allow the physician and the decision makers to trust the machine learning models. Our new method will combine prediction algorithms and cluster analysis algorithms.Decision makers need to rely on data when creating an action plan. But a ?black box? algorithm cannot provide the relevant information. Decisions need to be based on analysis process based. Our goal is to combine patient?s predictive algorithms with clustering algorithms in order to trace sub groups among asymptomatic and symptomatic patients.If we want to control the pandemic, we need to understand the way it is spreading.

We will use machine learning approaches on this large dataset to improve our understanding of health disparities based on race, gender and ethnicity in a range of COVID-related and behavioral health outcomes. We will also incorporate specimen data?particularly specimens related to immune-function (e.g., blood cytokines and other immune markers). This project has translational significance because it will include biological, psychological, and social factors that affect COVID severity and disease course.  We request access to level 2 individual-level data (HIPAA safe harbor data). Our research questions require individual rather than aggregate data. More specifically, using machine learning and multilevel analyses we will be able to model nuances in the individual-level data that would not be possible with synthetic data. Analyses of these data will provide critical insights to push the field forward that would not be possible with synthetic data."
"Deep Learning based models to predict COVID-19 patients outcomes","Lead Investigator: Laila Gindy Bekhet","Accessing Institution: The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston","There is an increased need for tools to help identify patients at high risk of clinical deterioration in an early phase. With the extensive use of electronic records and the availability of historical patient information, predictive models that can help identify patients at risk based on their history at an early stage can be a valuable adjunct to clinician judgment. Deep learning based models can help better predict patients' health outcomes using patients' clinical history information. We plan to train models that can predict different health outcomes on admission including mortality risk, intubation, and prolonged length of stay"
"Deep learning of longitudinal chest X-ray and clinical variables to predict needs for invasive mechanical ventilation and mortality in COVID-19 patients","Lead Investigator: Tim Duong","Accessing Institution: Albert Einstein College of Medicine","In principle, CXR could also be used to monitor disease progression and treatment response, optimize mechanical ventilator settings, determine when to safely extubate, and predict clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients. However, CXR is not currently being used in this capacity and thus the potential of CXR in COVID-19 is not yet be fully realized. This is in part because the temporal progression of COVID-19 lung infection on CXR is incompletely understood. CXR has become more relevant because a disproportionally large percentage of COVID-19 patients require invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) for a longer duration than patients with other similar lung infections. Improved understanding of the temporal progression of COVID-19 lung infection on CXR could be leveraged to address resource allocation in the event of a shortage of mechanical ventilators.We have recently developed machine learning algorithms that take CXR and non-imaging clinical data at multiple time points (1, 1-3 and 1-5 days on IMV) to predict duration of IMV (i.e., how much time the patient needs to be on IMV) and in-hospital mortality. Deep-learning predictions using longitudinal data outperformed those using single time-point data. The best prediction performance was obtained using both CXR and non-imaging clinical data (such as demographic, comorbidity, serial vital signs and serial laboratory tests) over five consecutive days, yielding an accuracy of 85?0.04% for predicting mortality, and 2.56?0.24 days for predicting the duration on IMV. The main goal of this N3C proposal is to determine whether these findings are generalizable to the N3C cohort."
"Developing an application to predict the severity of COVID-19 infections of individual patients by applying artificial intelligence methodologies","Lead Investigator: Kathryn Monopoli","Accessing Institution: University of Massachusetts Medical School","COVID19 is perplexing in how it impacts different individuals with drastic differences in severity. Understanding the how different individuals vary in susceptibility is essential to treating individuals efficiently and to identifying those at greater risk to minimize the impacts of the disease. We will develop an application applying artificial intelligence to predict the severity of COVID-19 symptoms a patient will experience based on the patient's presenting condition. Our study will utilize lab values from urine and blood tests from both patients who tested positive for COVID-19 and those who did not along with information about symptom severity for COVID-19 positive patients. Lab values will be used for analysis as these are standardized, rapid, low-cost diagnostic tests that provide great insight into a patient?s current health state and have been proven valuable in predicting outcomes in a broad range of diseases. This application could be applied to recommend treatment course for a patient to enable healthcare providers to make decisions quickly and allocate limited resources efficiently. This study will elucidate the complexities of COVID19 symptom presentation and, further, will aid in identifying individuals likely to be asymptomatic carriers."

We request the N3C Level 2 (de-identified) data to validate model performance metrics?including AUROC, sensitivity, specificity and negative predictive value analysis?on routine laboratory tests ordered from emergency departments (ED) visits. We also aim to explore model performance on laboratory tests ordered from non-ED patient encounters. The primary objective of this effort is to further demonstrate model robustness across clinical centers, patient pools, geography and demography, laboratory testing equipment and other idiosyncrasies of patient data collection. Our secondary objective is to explore the model performance  on inpatient encounters and ED encounters involving asymptomatic patients.  . Use of the AI-COVID model may help clinicians cohort potentially infectious patients, inform selective use of PCR-based testing for the diagnosis of COVID-19 infections, and improve quality of care for clinical institutions suffering limited resources."

Unfortunately, traditional drug discovery methods have a >90% failure rate and can take 10-15 years from target identification to clinical use. In contrast, drug repurposing can significantly accelerate translation. We developed a quantitative high-throughput screen to identify efficacious single agents and combination therapies against SARS-CoV-2. From a library of 1,441 FDA-approved compounds and clinical candidates, we identified 20 dose-responsive compounds with antiviral effects.  This research seeks to determine if the FDA-approved drugs exhibiting direct antiviral efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro have any clinical benefit."

"Drug Repurposing for Improving COVID-19 Outcomes","Lead Investigator: Ivana Maric","Accessing Institution: Stanford University","Currently, no therapeutics or pharmacological treatments exist for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Repurposing existing drugs that have already been established as safe, if shown effective, would lead to more options for treatment of COVID-19. In this project, we plan to investigate several drugs and classes of drugs, that we hypothesize could potentially be effective in reducing the severity of COVID-19 outcomes, based on their characteristics and biological pathways they affect. In our previous retrospective study that focused on statins, we observed a small, but statistically significant, decrease in mortality among patients prescribed statins when compared with matched COVID-19-positive controls. In this project, we plan to use the N3C cohort in a retrospective matched case-control study to study other drugs/classes of drugs of interest."
"Epidemiology of Acute and Chronic Kidney Injury Associated SARS-CoV-2 Infection","Lead Investigator: Chirag Parikh","Accessing Institution: Johns Hopkins University","Clinical acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in COVID-19 and is strongly associated with severity of disease and outcomes. Preliminary reports indicate that AKI occurs in approximately 20%-40% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and in 30-50% of those admitted to the intensive care unit. Moreover, the mortality rate in patients that experience AKI in the setting of COVID-19 is 2- to 10-fold higher than patients without AKI. The severity of AKI in COVID-19 has been overwhelming the resources needed for acute renal replacement therapy. This study propose to assess the incidence, severity, and clinical predictors of major adverse kidney events during hospitalization and at 90 days following discharge. AKI and AKI Stages will be defined using KDIGO creatinine criteria. Baseline serum creatinine will be defined as the last available creatinine measurement between 7 and 365 days before admission. All in-hospital serum creatinine measurements will be used to determine AKI. MAKE-D (Make Adverse Kidney Event) within 90 days (+/- 30 days) will be defined as the need for dialysis or a ?50% increase in serum creatinine OR post-discharge death."
"Evaluation of the Detection, Use, Benefits, and Adverse Effects of Anticoagulants Among Covid-19 Patients","Lead Investigator: Benjamin Bates","Accessing Institution: Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey","Increased incidence of arterial and venous thromboemboli (VTE) have been reported among individuals infected with SARS-CoV2. Due to the potential increased risk of VTE, prophylactic methods for COVID-19 hospitalized patients have included the use of higher-than-normal doses of anticoagulation have been proposed. Small, retrospective, single center or regionally based studies, early in the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated a potential benefit of higher-than-normal doses of anticoagulation. More recent studies have demonstrated no survival benefit with escalating doses of prophylactic anticoagulation, as well as differences of increased risk of major bleeding events with the escalation of anticoagulation intensity.  . There is a knowledge gap in the understanding of the utilization and effectiveness of anticoagulation among individuals hospitalized for COVID-19 and utilization and bleeding risk of anticoagulant use among groups of individuals at high risk for bleeding events. The National COVID Cohort Collective (N3C) represents a unique electronic health record (EHR) repository supported by the National Institute of Health. The data is structured using Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP).  Prior to assessing anticoagulant use, we will need to consider how to detect when a drug was ordered, administered, and stopped depending on the type of drug code used. This information concerning anticoagulation is imperative for our study but also will provide important knowledge on how to detect and consider drug exposure among hospitalized patients for present and future studies using N3C and other EHR-based OMOP studies. Overall, this study will assess the utilization, effectiveness, and bleeding risk based on varying doses of anticoagulation for patients hospitalized for COVID-19, while also evaluating the format of drug exposure within EHR-based OMOP drug structure. The four aims of this study are as follows: (1)	How are anticoagulants and other commonly prescribed medications in the hospital organized by each hospital within the N3C data structure based on route of exposure (e.g. oral, subcutaneous, and intravenous)? (2)	How are anticoagulants being utilized for individuals hospitalized for COVID-19 in the United States and whether comorbidities and other treatments may influence the dose and type of anticoagulant received? This aim will assess anticoagulant use among an individual throughout their hospitalization (3)	What is the effectiveness and general bleeding risk of escalating type and dose of anticoagulant for general cohort hospitalized for COVID-19? (4)	What is the use and bleeding risk among individuals who are at increased disposition for clotting and/or bleeding events?"
"Evaluation of the Relationship	Between Chronic Medication Use and COVID-19 Disease		","Lead Investigator: Alexandra Sierko","Accessing Institution: Auburn University","Background: COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is a devastating disease that has impacted the entire world population. Although little is known regarding the viral pathogenesis, there are numerous theories related to the viral mechanisms of infectivity. Recent research has identified a potential role for targets and disease processes that are directly affected by common medications. These components include the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), bradykinin signaling, vitamin D homeostasis, vasodilation, and the inflammatory response. The purpose of this project is to determine if chronic use of medications known to impact potential COVID-19 targets influences disease course and/or severity. Methods: We will conduct a retrospective review of the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) database to examine the relationship between chronic treatment with medications known to impact potential COVID-19 targets and disease course. Subject medications include RAAS inhibitors, such as angiotensin- converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor type I blockers (ARBs), bradykinin receptor antagonists, vitamin D supplements, vasodilators and vasoconstrictors (e.g. nitrates and ergots), anti-inflammatory drugs including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and corticosteroids, and interferons . Using the World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Progression Scale and the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) Classification COVID Severity Scale, correlation analyses will be used to identify relationships between chronic medication therapies and COVID disease course."

"Examining Associations between Vitamin D Status and COVID-19 Test Results","Lead Investigator: Thomas Best","Accessing Institution: University of Chicago","There is strong evidence from pre-COVID-19 data that vitamin D treatment decreases the incidence of viral respiratory tract infection, especially in vitamin D deficiency. Initial analysis indicates that vitamin D might also protect against COVID-19, but additional studies are urgently needed, ideally using large multi-site datasets. Our objective is to examine whether vitamin D status, reflecting vitamin D levels and treatment, is associated with COVID-19 test results among data in the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) enclave, and to submit findings for peer review by October 31, 2020. We will examine whether a patient?s most recent vitamin D status before COVID-19 testing is associated with their first COVID-19 test result with the use of multi-variable statistical models that mitigate potential confounding. This work will attempt to replicate our initial smaller-sample, single-site findings of associations between vitamin D status and COVID-19 test results, published in JAMA Network Open on September 3, 2020 (Meltzer et al. 2020). If we do not find similar results to our earlier analysis, we will seek to understand the reasons for different findings. If we do find similar results to our earlier analysis, it would increase confidence in our earlier findings to inform current decision making and provide further support for robust prospective studies."

These mappings will be used in multiple Covid-focused research projects that require clinical data in OMOP to be analyzed to OBO ontologies such as the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) or knowledge graphs that incorporate multiple OBO ontologies. They will support several broad classes of research goals in the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) such as biomarker discovery, drug repurposing, and advanced/precision phenotyping. Several projects are planned or are already underway within N3C which will require this infrastructure. Implementation of them will meet a critical need for a linking strategy between N3C research using NIH Biomedical Data Translator tools with the clinical data in N3C, for example. Initial use cases to demonstrate the value of these mappings will include studies of the psychiatric consequences of COVID and the characterization of COVID-infected patients with acute kidney injury. Additionally, we will work with the Machine Learning working group to develop novel mapping algorithms, which are trained on the OMOP2OBO mappings and applied to novel diseases and subphenotypes, which has the potential to reduce the burden of manual annotation."

"High-Throughput Covid-19 (sub)-Phenotyping for Personalized Patient Prognosis and Care","Lead Investigator: Ravi Srinivasan","Accessing Institution: The University of Texas at Austin","Most studies of COVID-19 risk factors (related to age, gender, diabetes, heart disease and hypertension, smoking, blood type, obesity,  environmental and genetic factors, etc.) have considered the effect of one ?factor? at a time, using standard cross-sectional multivariate modeling techniques. As such, they do not quantify the simultaneous effect of multiple, heterogeneous factors, and the factors considered are relatively few and hand-picked. For example, all the studies mentioned in a recent meta-survey of EHR-based data analysis [Chen et al., IEEE JBHI, 2016] fall in this category. Similarly, in terms of patient progression over time, only classical biostatistics approaches such as Cox proportional hazards (conditioned on a few covariates) have been considered [Chen et al., J. Biomed. Inform, 2015]. Both types of studies are handicapped by not being able to consider the dynamic multi-way interactions among numerous potential factors that uniquely characterize COVID-19. There is a compelling need to identify a large number of fine-grained patient subgroups that are relatively homogeneous in terms of infection progression and treatment needs, which can then enable us to provide much more personalized and targeted treatments for substantially improved outcomes. Such groups can be determined by developed COVID-specific sub-phenotypes, however traditional phenotyping approaches (such as eMERGE) take many months of human expertise to produce a small number of ?gold-standard? phenotypes. This proposal provides a much faster alternative to a year-plus wait for golden COVID-19 phenotypes.

Chronic comorbidities appear to be driving factors for COVID-19 mortality. Although evidence to date does not suggest that people living with HIV (PLWH) have a markedly higher susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, chronic conditions are more prevalent in people living with HIV than non-infected individuals. Therefore, on top of the other common comorbidities (e.g., asthma, chronic lung disease, diabetes, cardiovascular conditions, chronic kidney disease, obesity), warnings to take extra precautions should also include persons who are immunocompromised, such as PLWH. Existing literature that investigated the health outcomes of COVID-19 patients who are co-infected with HIV are very limited, with the available data mainly appear in case reports and case series of COVID-19-HIV co-infected patients, and almost all are small-scale studies with findings inconclusive. This study aims to use N3C enclave data to perform a large scale retrospective observational study to characterize outcomes in COVID-19 patients with/without HIV infection. Our team is requesting access to level 2 de-identified data to gain a better understanding of how HIV infection affect COVID-19 outcomes."

"Identification of Novel COVID-19 Subphenotypes Using Temperature Trajectories","Lead Investigator: Sivasubramanium Bhavani","Accessing Institution: Emory University","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected over 35 million people and caused over 1 million deaths as of October, with numbers continuing to rise. Fever is one of the hallmarks of COVID-19, and body temperature is one of the most frequently obtained clinical measurements. Since temperature is closelytied to the immune response to infection, the pattern of temperature over time (i.e., temperature trajectories) could predict mortality in COVID-19. Further, temperature trajectories could predict which patients will respond to what therapies. Using large inpatient data from hospitals around the country, I am applyingmachine learning to identify clusters of patients following distinct temperature trajectories. Understanding the different body temperature responses to COVID-19 will allow us to use this age-old clinical measurement to prognosticate and identify subgroups. These COVID-19 subgroups could lead to the precision medicineapproach to treating this severe disease."

Whether discrete omics features such as molecular level changes, host/viral genomic variants, differential gene expression will exhibit different clinical outcomes. Identifying epidemiological variables and patient characteristics and  and omics features to be considered in studies with multi-omics to investigate molecular mechanisms of COVID-19  is an essential task to optimize cost and efforts. We hypothesize that the evolutionary and temporal dynamics of CoV-2 transmission during treatment will generate distinct genomic and biomarker signatures in association with epidemiological data. We will apply statistical and deep learning models to identify important measured omics data (e.g., viral genome, metabolites, proteins, host expression, and microbiome) in association to health outcomes. We use large-scale data from monitored communities such as vaccinated individuals to detect and decipher drug-resistance and, eventually, vaccine-resistance. We will also test seasonality patterns as the pandemic extends beyond one year. In addition our focus will be on pregnancy and cardiovascular domains data. We request Level 2 de-identified data from the N3C to associate patient characteristics and clinical variables with treatments and health outcomes."

"Identifying predictors for ECMO need in COVID 19 patients","Lead Investigator: Ahmed Said","Accessing Institution: Washington University in St. Louis","The novel SARS-CoV2 virus and resulting COVID-19 global pandemic have put unforeseen strain on healthcare systems globally. It is incredibly challenging to know when and where to deploy resources, this is especially true for utilizing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). This technology functions as life sustaining therapy for the most severely affected patients, but only exists in centers with expertise. Utilizing ECMO puts a strain on local resources, and strain on healthcare systems as a whole when deciding when patients need to be transported to experienced regional centers.We plan to analyze our the N3C data to identify factors that are associated with the need for ECMO support in COVID-19 patients. We will analyze the demographics, therapeutics, laboratory values, vital signs, as well as change in these values associated with the binary outcome of necessitating ECMO support in addition to outcomes for patients supported by ECMO."
"Impact of COVID-19 infection in patients with pulmonary non-tuberculous Mycobacterium (NTM) infection: A cohort study.","Lead Investigator: Carlos Figueroa Castro","Accessing Institution: Medical College of Wisconsin","COVID-19 is an infection caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, a novel coronavirus causing acute respiratory infection. It is considered a pandemic, affecting at least 31 million people and causing almost a million deaths worldwide. As of September 28, 2020, the virus has infected more than six million in the United States, and caused more than 200,000 deaths. Based on observational studies, multiple risk factors have been associated to poor outcomes, including advanced age, and cardiac and pulmonary conditions. However, the data used for establishing the level of risk in special populations is difficult to extract and analyze when compared to studies analyzing the general population.Our research team is interested in studying the impact of COVID-19 infection in patients with pulmonary non-tuberculous Mycobacterium (NTM) infections. These infections tend to affect people with pulmonary conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis (CF), bronchiectasis, and certain humoral and cellular immunodeficiency conditions. These infections have a worldwide distribution. In the United States, the most common cause of NTM infections is M.avium intracellulare complex (MAC). The mainstay of therapy is antibiotic therapy, usually a combination of a macrolide (azithromycin, clarithromycin), ethambutol, and rifampin for 18-24 months. Reinfection is common. It is not known whether these patients are at a higher risk for COVID-19 infection, or its severe manifestation."
"Impact of Dermatology Consults on COVID-19 Inpatient Outcomes","Lead Investigator: Julia Mhlaba","Accessing Institution: Northwestern University","The novel coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with several dermatologic manifestations. Case series have reported a wide range of skin findings including pernio-like lesions, erythematous macular or papular rashes, morbilliform or varicelliform eruptions, urticaria, vesicles, petechiae, purpura, livedo reticularis-like lesions, and acro-ischemic lesions (Freeman et al. 2020). In many cases, the presentation of these cutaneous signs appeared concurrently with or prior to the onset of other COVID-19 symptoms. Thus, dermatologist involvement may expedite COVID-19 diagnosis and improve management. We are requesting Level 2 de-identified data to compare mortality rates, length of hospitalization, and treatment modalities for patients with COVID-19 who had a dermatology provider involved in their care versus those who did not."

"Investigating the impact of biases on the performance of analytical models for COVID-19 related care.","Lead Investigator: Suranga Kasthurirathne","Accessing Institution: Indiana University","Artificial?intelligence (AI)?offers?considerable?potential to support efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. However, a majority of datasets used for COVID research were originally collected in support of patient care or to document costs, and not in support of research purposes. The quality of such datasets may be influenced by prejudiced decision making, poor representation of vulnerable populations, and incompleteness or errors in data collection and processing[1, 2]. These issues contribute to bias, which is broadly defined as systematic errors resulting in one population being favored over another[2]. Use of such datasets for analytics leads to the garbage in - garbage out problem[3] resulting in biased analytical models harmful to vulnerable populations such as minorities, seniors, women, persons with special healthcare needs or those impacted by adverse SDoH[4, 5]. These concerns are particularly relevant in context of the COVID epidemic, which has raised serious questions on disparities in care across diverse patient populations. As such, there is an urgent need to Investigate analytical models for biases caused by demographic factors such as race/ethnicity, gender or age, or various SDoH. Our long-term goal is to develop reproducible methods to address systematic analytical biases targeting vulnerable populations. The objective of this proposal is to mitigate analytical biases in AI models that predict COVID related care needs. 1.	Roebuck K.

The overall scope or statistical power of existing studies has largely been limited by small cohorts. Access to the de-identified (Level 2) N3C data will allow us to revisit these questions on an unprecedented scale and better understand rarer long-term consequences of the disease. Both hypothesis and data-driven approaches will be used to carry out investigations into three key areas. The first involves the effect of particular drugs and drug classes in treating different stages and/or cohorts of COVID-19 including but not limited to: SSRIs, ACE inhibitors, corticosteroids, antivirals, and antihistamines. Preliminary studies have indicated that at least some of these therapies may decrease overall mortality or reduce the likelihood of clinical deterioration, although some data are conflicting. The second relates to the quantification and prediction of the relative risk, and the factors contributing to that risk, for COVID-19 patients across the severity spectrum. These models will be analyzed across various vulnerable patient cohorts including but not limited to: diabetics, COPD, kidney disease, immunocompromised patients, etc. Also, assessing the risk of specific complications over a larger population to more comprehensively determine outcome rates and comorbidities will be performed with the N3C dataset.

"Liver Function as a Predictor of COVID-19 Outcomes","Lead Investigator: Bijun Kannadath","Accessing Institution: University of Arizona","Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) is primarily a disease affecting the respiratory system. The major cause of morbidity and mortality resultant in infected patients is from the development of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). However, The affinity of the virus for ACE2 receptors and the presence of ACE2 receptors in other body systems such as the liver, heart, skeletal muscle and nervous system has resulted in various non-respiratory manifestations of COVID-19. These non-respiratory manifestations include anosmia, myocarditis, prolonged myalgia, fatigue, memory loss. The liver is also vulnerable similarly. Virus particles can multiply within the liver to cause direct cytopathic effects. COVID-19 associated liver injury is now well documented in patients without pre-existing liver disease with elevated Liver Function Tests (LFTs) being reported frequently. Additionally, the cytokine storm associated with severe disease, systemic hypoxia and Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) may also contribute to deterioration in liver function. Thus we hypothesis that the temporal analysis of the changes in LFTs over the course of a patient?s illness and treatment will reveal early markers of clinical deterioration and/or mortality. This study aims to study the patterns of progression of liver injury in COVID-19 patients and to discover associations with any patient co-morbidities and to determine if LFTs can serve as a predictor of COVID-19 disease severity and progression."

"Machine Learning for Disparities in COVID-19 Patient Outcomes","Lead Investigator: Vicki Hertzberg","Accessing Institution: Emory University","Racial disparities in the clinical course of COVID-19 illness exist. In particular, Blacks experience more severe disease and higher case fatality rates than whites. The reasons for these differences are not readily apparent. A better understanding of patient-specific factors predicting COVID-19 outcomes in Black hospitalized patients will improve understanding of racial disparities in this disease. To this end we propose to use machine learning techniques to develop predictive models for adverse clinical outcomes among Black and white patients hospitalized with COVID-19, addressing the following specific aims and research questions:1. Aim 1: Predict adverse patient outcomes in Black and white hospitalized COVID-19 patients using machine learning.? How well do existing risk scores predict patient outcomes in this population?? Can two machine learning models, one trained on Blacks and the other on whites, provide betterpredictions of patient outcomes?? How do Blacks and whites compare for existing risk scores as well for our model(s)?2.

"Machine Learning for Identifying Severe Outcome Risk Factors in COVID-19","Lead Investigator: ELAINE HILL","Accessing Institution: University of Rochester","Risk factors of COVID-19 mortality, and other severe outcomes, have thus far been identified based on clinical studies using traditional statistical methods. Understanding of the full suite of the risk factors remains limited and the true death toll of the pandemic is unknown. The objective of this research is to develop a replicable framework for identifying risk factors for severe COVID-19 outcomes using N3C cohort data and advanced data-driven methods. The use of advanced machine-learning methods to achieve this objective is critical, as traditional statistical methods may not be able to handle issues likely present in these data, including severe multicollinearity, a high imbalance between known COVID-19 involved and non-involved cases, and sparsity. Using the limited data set (level 3) from N3C and machine-learning techniques, we will identify predictors of severe COVID-19 illness (e.g., hospitalization, ICU use, ventilator use). In our main models, we will include individual demographics, clinical factors, and underlying medical conditions as well as county and 5-digit zip code-level demographic, economic, and social characteristics. For exploratory analyses, we will include data on healthcare resources and local environmental characteristics."
"Machine Learning to Predict COVID-19 Risk","Lead Investigator: Ryan Melvin","Accessing Institution: University of Alabama at Birmingham","The COVID-19 pandemic continues to be a major healthcare crisis at the time of this writing.  In this work, we apply a deep learning technique for combining multiple machine learning models ? each considering a different set of facts for the prediction of a positive test for COVID-19.  The output of the model is the prediction of a positive test for COVID-19. Additionally, using variable importance methods, we report the most predictive risk factors in the final trained model.  The final model is a set of multi-layer perceptrons trained in concert with one another whose outputs are combined by a final layer which outputs a class (positive test or negative test).  This paper shows that deep learning provides novel insights into the risk factors predictive of a positive COVID-19 test."

The N3C limited Data Set (N3CLDS) will be used to estimate the risk of contracting/transmitting COVID-19.Objectives, designs, and plans: Given the prolonged pandemic, many companies/schools have started to implement programs involving COVID-19 testing, symptom reporting, and contact tracing to safely bring people back to work/school. However, the programs mainly rely on passive reporting and universal testing schedules without considering the heterogeneity in a workforce. Models that can actively guide the logistics of testing is essential to control the disease transmission effectively. We performed a pilot study on risk factors of COVID-19 infection from EMR data at Mount Sinai Health System.  However, the study population was limited to NYC area. To obtain more accurate and generalizable estimates of an individual?s risk of contracting and transmitting COVID-19, data from N3CLDS are essential given the comprehensive information on individual-level risk factors with the wide geographical coverage. We propose a Bayesian hierarchical model to incorporate data from individual and community levels. In turn, this estimated risk can serve as an indicator for individuals who might need more frequent testing. Additionally, the model can be expanded to include a network-based transmission model to integrate contact network structures where necessary."

The mortality rate for patients with kidney disease is also significantly higher than the general infected population. However, the big variation of AKI incidence in COVID-19 patients appears to depend on many factors such as race, region, and disease severity. We plan to use the N3C cohort to detect, compare, and analyze the occurrences of kidney disease following COVID-19 infection. We will apply machine learning techniques to try to better predict patients that are more likely to develop a kidney disease following COVID-19 infection.

"Predicting organ failure in patients with COVID-19","Lead Investigator: Chengda Zhang","Accessing Institution: Oregon Health & Science University","Patients with COVID-19 may demonstrate completely different clinical course. While most patients remain asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, some patients could experience progressively worsening multi-organ failure, requiring intensive care. The underlying pathophysiology is unclear, however, early recognition of patients with high risk for deterioration could significantly help with clinical decision making, resource allocation, and potentially shed light on further pathophysiological studies. This project aims to develop machine learning algorithms to select patients' of high risk for respiratory failure, renal failure and heart failure from COVID-19.The data that would be necessary to train the machine learning algorithm would include COVID-19 positive patients' demographics (age, gender, ethnicity, smoking history), existing medical conditions, home medication, vital signs, common lab results (CBC, chemistry, troponin, lactate, arterial/venous blood gas). In order to determine patients' outcome, we would need to access patient's lab results such as serum creatinine, N-terminal (NT)-pro hormone BNP (NT-proBNP), BNP, urinanalysis, arterial/venous blood gas; documentation regarding whether patients required mechanical ventilation, and patients' daily intake-output; and imaging studies such as chest CT, chest Xray, echocardiogram with interpretation. In order to manage the level of noise and increase algorithm performance, potential confounding factors may need to be considered in the algorithm, such as dose and frequency of medications that patients are receiving 2 weeks prior to the onset of acute organ failure, severity of patients' pre-existing organ failure, such as chronic renal failure, COPD/asthma and chronic heart failure (which can be assessed by certain lab results, previous pulmonary function tests, echocardiogram, as well as patient's living situation (home vs long-term care facility)).

However, these models disregard the embedded connectedness(e.g., network characteristics)of various comorbidities to understand the long COVID-19 effects, which leads to underperforming models for health outcomes.The proposed study will investigate the long-term effects of COVID-19 such as impact on heart and nervous systems, chronic fatigue, etc. while considering their network characteristics of the disease, individual patient characteristics, and health conditions of patients at the aggregate level. The proposed research aims to develop a comprehensive descriptive and predictive model for long COVID-19 by considering patient characteristics, demographics, medical history and their connectedness properties using network analytic approaches. Network features such as density, page rank, eigenvector centrality, betweenness centrality, etc., for each (sub) network that they belong to could provide features for the predictive model. Research questions that we will explore in this study are: Question1: Does patient belonging to a network (subgraph) has high risk propensity to develop particular types of long-COVID-19 symptoms than a patient belonging to a heterogeneous network(subgraph)?Question 2: Predictive model for long COVID-19that includes patient as well as their connectedness to comorbidities and conditions?"
"Prevalence and outcomes of co-infection and super-infection with SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens","Lead Investigator: Jackson  Musuuza","Accessing Institution: University of Wisconsin?Madison","Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) can have other respiratory infections present at the time of SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis. In medical terms this is called co-infection. On the other hand, these patients can acquire new infections during the process of treatment for COVID-19. This is referred to as superinfection. Recent research has shown that the presence of either co-infections or super-infections may lead to poor patient outcomes such as an increased risk of death and higher likelihood of the need to help patients breathe (mechanical ventilation), prolonged length of hospital stay (LOS) and need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission. In this study we will use the N3C data to determine the proportion of COVID-19 patients that also have co-infections and that of COVID-19 that subsequently get super-infections. We will also examine factors that might increase the likelihood of having these extra infections among COVID-19 and outcomes of occurrence of co-infections and super-infections among COVID-19 patients."

"Retrospective identification of medications to treat COVID-19","Lead Investigator: Ben Richardson","Accessing Institution: Southern Illinois University School of Medicine","COVID-19 is a disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 which has infected over 11 million people in the US and killed over 250,000. Many avenues are currently being pursued to help mitigate the spread and lethality of the virus, including vaccine development, more rapid testing, and repurposing of already-approved pharmacotherapeutics. Unfortunately, the novelty of SARS-CoV-2 is requiring the development of new treatments, which takes time and are not yet available for successfully treating and eliminating the virus. However, repurposing already-approved drugs may be a more rapidly-available solution in the short term while vaccines are not yet widely available. To evaluate the potential therapeutic benefit of existing drug regimens to limit duration and severity of COVID-19 disease, the disease (observation) duration, death events, and multi-day hospital stays in COVID-19-positive patients in the N3C database will be evaluated as they relate to patient exposures to specific drug classes. We will evaluate level 2 de-identified data to identify relationships between lower disease severity/shorter duration and concurrent exposure to specific drugs or drug class may identify novel treatment strategies to lower disease severity, death rates, and reduce spread. Such identification of effective pharmacotherapies may also highlight novel targets for the development of future treatments or vaccines."

"Role of comorbidities, sex hormones, inflammatory biomarkers, and socio-demographic factors in sex differences of COVID-19 outcomes","Lead Investigator: Yilin Yoshida","Accessing Institution: Tulane University","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is characterized by a male predominance in severity and mortality worldwide, but reasons underlying the sex-bias are unclear. Sex differences in comorbidities, sex hormones, and inflammatory biomarkers may all be factors involved in the sex differences of COVID-19 outcomes. However, few studies examined the role of these factors in COVID-19 outcomes stratified by sex. In our recent study in a COVID cohort of adults in Louisiana, we observed sex differences in comorbidities and biomarkers as predictors of COVID-19 severe outcomes. Our study underscores the need for a larger study with sex-stratification and robust analysis to determine if our findings are region-specific or hold generalizability to other populations.

"Smoking and COVID-19 Outcomes in U.S. Adults (SCOTUS)","Lead Investigator: Jay Atanda","Accessing Institution: United States National Library of Medicine","Recent systematic reviews exploring the association between smoking and COVID-19 related outcomes provide conflicting evidence. Farsalinos et al (2020) for example raise the hypothesis that nicotine may have a beneficial effect on COVID-19 in their meta-analysis of 13 published papers. Their preliminary analysis did not support the argument that current smoking is a risk factor for hospitalization for COVID-19. Glantz et al (2020) on the other hand, in their own review of 12 published papers report a significant association between smoking and COVID-19 progression. At least three earlier reviews also reached different conclusions or were inconclusive. All highlight these gaps 1) the importance of data where smoking status are accurately recorded, 2) the role of and possible influence of confounding factors and selection bias that underlying studies did not consider, and 3) the need for observational studies where smoking is the primary exposure of interest. Our objective is to conduct a retrospective case-control study using de-identified data from the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) and; 1) examine the prevalence of current smoking among U.S. hospitalized cases with COVID relative to the general population, and 2) examine the association between smoking status and COVID-19 clinical outcomes. This study will contribute to the literature on smoking association with COVID-19 outcomes and fill the gaps identified above, and is especially important here in the U.S. (only one of the studies in the existing reviews is from the U.S.) where 34.2M adults currently smoke and 16M live with a smoking-related disease."

"Study Phenotype of COVID-19 in Patients with Hemophilia: A National Cohort Study","Lead Investigator: Anjali Sharathkumar","Accessing Institution: University of Iowa","Hypercoagulable state plays pivotal role in pathogenesis of Novel Coronavirus 2019 SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) disease. It is characterized by clinical thrombosis in up to 30% of patients, which in turn is associated with poor outcome. In general, the prothrombotic milieu is mediated through activation of coagulation and elevation in procoagulant proteins such as factor VIII(FVIII), factor IX(FIX), Von Willebrand factor (VWF) and fibrinogen. Established risk factors for COVID-19 including age, gender, cancer, diabetes and hypertension are known to be associated with elevation of these procoagulant proteins implying their role in determining the disease severity. Factors VIII and IX are critical for thrombogenesis as hemophilia patients with deficiency of these proteins, hemophilia A and B respectively, experience life-threatening bleeding diathesis. Therefore a subset of hemophilia patients with severe bleeding phenotype require treatment with regular administration of FVIII and FIX concentrates to prevent and treat bleeding. Never the less, it is unclear if patients with hypo-coagulable state associated with congenital deficiency of FVIII and FIX proteins are less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and or have milder course if infected by this virus. The proposed study leverages upon the wealth of N3C Data Enclave and its powerful analytic capabilities. The deidentified dataset from N3C data will be used to characterize the phenotypic variability and outcomes of COVID-19 in hemophilia patients B. The research activities in this proposal will not only enable us to develop tailored strategies for better prevention and treatment of COVID-19 in hemophilia population but will guide us about appropriate regimen for factor replacement therapy during this pandemic."

The heterogeneous data poses a challenge for efficient extrapolation of information into clinical applications. We have rapidly collated 145 COVID-19 biomarkers through crowdsourcing efforts by leveraging a robust data model developed to capture cancer biomarker data. Our expanding resource has comprehensive data from multiple structured ontology databases. Most biomarkers are related to the immune (SAA, TNF-?, and IP-10) or coagulation (D-dimer, antithrombin, and VWF) cascades, suggesting complex vascular pathobiology of the disease. Furthermore, we observe commonality with established cancer biomarkers (ACE2, IL-6, IL-4 and IL-2) as well as biomarkers for metabolic syndrome and diabetes (CRP, NLR, LDL). Given our progress in establishing a COVID-19 biomarker knowledgebase, we are now in a position to validate proposed associations between biomarkers and clinical outcomes with the exceptional N3C data enclave.  We propose to test our biomarker associations using insights from our database for biomarker selection, but focusing solely on N3C data to test for associations of biomarkers with clinical outcomes. All analyses will be conducted within the N3C enclave. No data will be imported or exported. Our results will provide further evidence to support (or refute) biomarker association with clinical outcomes, leading to better application of biomarkers in clinical settings."

As uncontrolled diabetes may lead to increases in morbidity, mortality, and costs of care for patients, it is paramount that patients achieve and maintain their glycemic goals. In an effort to promote positive glycemic outcomes, a reliable patient-provider relationship and regular follow-up are cornerstones of quality diabetic care. ?n March 2020, several states underwent emergency stay-at-home orders in an effort to suppress the peak of the Novel Coronavirus, COVID-19. Healthcare facilities were forced to alter their care and reschedule routine care patients for later dates. Among these routine patients were both controlled and uncontrolled diabetics.

"The relationship between cardiac arrhythmias and SARS-CoV-2; an incidence and mortality analysis","Lead Investigator: Yousif Arif","Accessing Institution: University of California, Irvine","We already know that patients admitted to the ICU have an increased risk for developing cardiac arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, sinus tachycardia, etc.). Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common arrhythmia in the critically ill and presents with an increased risk for thromboembolic stroke and heart failure. In the ICU, AF has been shown to be associated with adverse outcomes. The acute loss of atrial systole and onset of rapid ventricular rates associated with new-onset AF leads to hemodynamic instability in the critically ill. The etiology of new-onset AF explains why it can be a marker for patient outlook/status. Many patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 report palpitations as a symptom of the disease course. With many of the ICU beds currently being utilized to treat patients with a more severe case of SARS-CoV-2, we are interested in investigating whether there is a relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and the development of cardiac arrhythmias (such as AF). We are also interested in elucidating whether or not there is an association between cardiac arrhythmias and mortality amongst SARS-CoV-2 patients."

We will estimate survival using the product-limit Kaplan-Meier curve and use the log-rank test to compare survival curves. We will use a complete case analysis. Treatments administered with a frequency less than 1% will not be considered in the univariate analysis. We then first fit a univariate Cox proportional-hazards model to screen for potential therapies that are associated with mortality. We then use a multivariable Cox proportional-hazards model to estimate independent associations between therapies and hospital mortality. The multivariable analysis includes known patient risk factors for mortality (age, sex, hypertension, requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation) and the therapies selected based on the results of univariate analysis. This is an exploratory investigation. The results of this study will facilitate the investigation of the effective treatments of COVID-19."
"Understanding non-invasive ventilation treatment failures in COVID-19","Lead Investigator: Ivy Benjenk","Accessing Institution: George Washington University","Intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) is widely recognized as a necessary intervention for patients suffering from respiratory failure. Critically ill COVID-19 patients often present with severe hypoxia, prompting the need respiratory support. However, early reports revealed a high rate of mortality among COVID-19 patients who received mechanical ventilation. Additionally, intubation presents risks for COVID-19 transmission to providers.  This has prompted further investigation into noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV) to avoid intubation if possible, such as high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) or noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). Both HFNC and NIPPV are proven modalities in non-COVID-19 pathologies, such as flash pulmonary edema and COPD exacerbations. NIPPV was shown to reduce intubation by 70% for critically ill SARS-Cov-1 patients. Data is still limited on whether NIPPV reduces intubation in SARS-Cov-2. This study aims to better understand the characteristics of patients with COVID-19 that are most likely to benefit from NIMV in order to guide clinical decision making."
"Understanding the impact of HIV-infection on COVID-19 ","Lead Investigator: Sandra Safo","Accessing Institution: University of Minnesota","Several risk factors have been documented to be associated with severe COVID-19 including comorbidities such as cardiovascular diseases (CVD), chronic respiratory diseases (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases [COPD]), and epidemiologic factors such as age, sex, and race. Meanwhile, the role of HIV infection and immunosuppression on the severity of COVID-19 remains unclear.  Persons living with HIV (PLWH) oftentimes have CVD and COPD earlier and at rates higher than the general population. In addition, research suggests that inflammatory biomarkers are associated with severity of COVID-19. In PLWH, there is an increased levels of inflammatory biomarkers that are associated with poor outcomes such as death.  Our team is requesting access to the Level 2 de-identified data to gain a better understanding of the impact of HIV infection on the severity of COVID-19, and to identify potential individuals and subgroups with increased risk for severe illness."
"Use, Safety and Effectiveness of Therapies to Treat COVID-19","Lead Investigator: Hemalkumar Mehta","Accessing Institution: Johns Hopkins University","The coronavirus pandemic has generated enormous interest in identifying effective treatments that reduce morbidity and mortality from COVID-19. Since the beginning of the pandemic, important discoveries regarding potential treatments for COVID-19 have been made, ranging from the role of products such as remdesivir and dexamethasone in treating individuals with active infection to the safety of ambulatory use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) among individuals who may be at risk of COVID-19 infection. Despite these insights, innumerable questions remain. In part, this is because while clinical trials typically represent the gold standard method to assess therapeutic efficacy, few trials have been completed and real-world use often differs from the context in which products are studied. In addition, randomized trials are generally designed to quantify efficacy but often do not allow for rigorous assessment of potentially uncommon but clinically important safety concerns. Thus, the importance of the work of the Pharmacoepidemiology Task Team, namely, to evaluate important, empirically testable hypotheses regarding the use, safety and effectiveness of therapies for COVID-19 using a limited data set from the N3C.  These data will provide urgently needed information regarding the use, safety and effectiveness of products used among patients with COVID-19."
"Using Machine Learning to differentiate COVID-19 infection with seasonal flu ","Lead Investigator: Ran Dai","Accessing Institution: University of Nebraska Medical Center","With the COVID-19 pandemic ongoing and the flu season approaching, there will be a challenge for people to differentiate the two diseases based on their symptoms. Therefore, the COVID-19 testing centers will potentially face challenges of reaching testing capacity and higher risks for infection due to increased number of people going on site tests. Our goal is to use machine learning method to build a classification model to establish a pre-test screening system to help people self-evaluate their risks with COVID-19 during the flu season to decrease their possibility with COVID-19 infection. We are requesting Level 2 de-identified data for this purpose."
"Using N3C to Apply Pharmacoepidemiologic Methods to Answer Questions about COVID-19 Treatment","Lead Investigator: Jessica Young","Accessing Institution: University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to spread globally, researchers are urgently trying to find safe and effective treatment options for this novel disease. The National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) offers a centralized repository of electronic health records (EHR) from over 60 sites, including over 1.5 million patients that can be leveraged to study potential treatments for COVID-19.  The N3C enclave is an invaluable tool enabling timely and important research to help combat the COVID-19 epidemic. Assessments of treatment options using these data can inform critical public health questions and impact treatment choices in critically ill patients. In this time of increased urgency to assess treatment options, it will be important that researchers think critically about best practices using these data.EHR data have long been used for retrospective observational research evaluating treatment options. These data require specialized study designs and analytic techniques to avoid well-understood biases. We aim to use the N3C data to demonstrate best practices in using these retrospective data, and to illustrate how failure to use these best methods can result in biased study results."
"Validate a Machine Learning Model to Predict Decompensation in Patients with COVID-19","Lead Investigator: Mikhail Attaar","Accessing Institution: University of Chicago","The research question we seek to answer utilizing de-identified data is whether in patients diagnosed with COVID-19, are there any clinical or laboratory factors that can predict which patients will experience clinical deterioration. We define clinical deterioration as one of the following: 1) admission to the intensive care unit; 2) progression to requiring invasive mechanical ventilation; 3) failure of one or more organs; or 4) mortality. The factors we plan to investigate include patient demographics, comorbidities, medications and laboratory values."
"Vitamin D deficiency in diabetic patients with COVID-19 ","Lead Investigator: Nikhila Gandrakota","Accessing Institution: Emory University","Vitamin D deficiency is associated with increased risk of infections and it has been associated with increasing morbidity and mortality in COVID -19 infections. Diabetes is also one of the most common co-morbidities linked to the severe outcomes of COVID-19. Evidence has shown a pathophysiologic link between diabetes and COVID-19 which is more evident in Vitamin D deficient patients.  This study plans to explore relationship between vitamin D deficiency and if its supplementation would affect COVID -19 outcomes in patients with diabetes."
